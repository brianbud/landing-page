Project by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page) to create a landing page using HTML and CSS with just a [design image to follow](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png)
